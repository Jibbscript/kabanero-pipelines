Kabanero ships a default set of tasks and pipelines that illustrate a variety of CI/CD functions.  Some of the functions include validating the application stack is active on the cluster, building applications stacks using appsody, pushing the built image to an image repositiry, deploying the application to the cluster, amongst other things.  These tasks and pipeline work with the default Kabanero application stacks and in many cases might work as is for new application stacks you might create.  However there are cases where you might want to update the tasks or pipelines or create new ones.  This guide will go over the steps to make those updates and how you can update your kabanero CR to use your new pipeline release.
